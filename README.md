# gbgtechradar

Gothenburg Tech Radar is a monthly meetup group based in Gothenburg, Sweden.

The purpose of the group is to inspire an open discussion about software, technology and methodologies - inspired by the Thoughtworks technology radar:

https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar

In short; software to adopt, software to keep, and software to avoid.

Each meeting will have a generic topic.


To avoid a too wide span of interests; we will keep this group unix- and open source- oriented.

Each meetup should result in a tech radar representation of the technology discussed.
